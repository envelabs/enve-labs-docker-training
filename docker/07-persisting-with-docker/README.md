# Persisting with Docker

Applications consume or produce data, and due the nature of the containers, which are in essence ephemerals, meaning that use to be stateless. How are we going to keep data generated by containers?

Docker `volumes` help us to solve this problem. `Volumes` allow containers to consume, produce, and modify a state. `Volumes` have a life cycle that goes beyond the life cycle of containers. When a container that uses a volume dies, the information generated by the container persist in the `volume`.

There exists to methods in order to use volumes.

### Data volumes
Data volumes are a file system spaces, reserved to be used and shared by containers

listing volumes

    docker volume ls

create a volume named `enve-data-vol`

    docker volume create enve-data-vol

instpect the volume

    docker volume inspect enve-data-vol

mounting a volume into a container

    docker container run --name enve-data-test -it \
    -v enve-data-vol:/data \
    alpine /bin/sh

remove container `enve-data-test`

    docker container rm -f enve-data-test

remove a volume

    docker volume rm enve-data-vol


### Bind volumes
Bind volumes are a file systems spaces that already exist in the `host` machine and can be `shared` with a container

    docker container run -d \
      --name enve-data-test2 \
      -v $(pwd)/volume:/usr/share/nginx/html \
      -p 8080:80 \
      nginx
